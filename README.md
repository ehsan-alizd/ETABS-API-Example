# ETABS-API-Example
An example of how to use the ETABS API with Python

I developed these scripts to streamline the process of creating my ETABS archetypes using the API for my masterâ€™s thesis. These scripts provide a step-by-step procedure for drawing elements, especially curved braces, defining various model settings, and performing analysis and capacity-limited design.

These scripts serve as a valuable example of how to use the ETABS API with Python, especially considering the lack of comprehensive documentation on this topic.

Please note that these scripts are customized for my personal use. Due to limitations in the API, I had to manually complete certain tasks where commands were insufficient.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or are interested in working with the ETABS API!
